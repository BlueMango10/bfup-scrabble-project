# BFUP: Scrabble Project
This is a student project for the course 'Functional Programming, SWU (Sprint 2022)' at ITU Copenhagen.

The project is made as a group consisting of the following people:
- Gustav Samuel Bonde Holmgren (guho@itu.dk)
- Magnus Dalsgaard Larsen (daml@itu.dk)

## We have implemented the following requirements:
- Bot can play against itself on an infinite board (2 points, mandatory)
- Multi-player and dictionary (1 point)

## To Run:
The startup project should be `ScrabbleTemplate`. If you want to run the program with `dotnet run`, you will need to change the dictionary path in `Program.fs` line 41.
